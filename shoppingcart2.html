	Active: Observing Model Changes with $watch
	Bug:	L54 $scope.discount; -> $scope.bill.discount;
	
	$watch(watchFn, watchAction, deepWatch)
	
	The details of each parameter are as follows:
	
	watchFn
		This parameter is a string with an Angular expression or a function that returns
		the current value of the model that you want to watch. This expression will be
		evaluated multiple times, so you need to make sure that it has no side effects. That
		is, it can be called multiple times without changing state. For the same reason, watch
		expressions should be computationally cheap. If you’ve passed in an Angular ex‐
		pression in a string, it will be evaluated against objects available to the scope it’s
		called on.
	watchAction
		This is the function or expression to be called when the watchFnchanges. In the
		function form, it receives the new and old values of watchFnas well as a reference
		to the scope. Its signature is function(newValue, oldValue, scope).
	deepWatch
		If set to true, this optional boolean parameter tells Angular to examine each prop‐
		erty within the watched object for changes. You’d use this if you wanted to watch
		individual elements in an array or properties in an object instead of just a simple
		value. As Angular needs to walk the array or object, this can be computationally
		expensive if the collection is large.
